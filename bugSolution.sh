# This script demonstrates a safer approach to file creation and reading,
# mitigating the race condition by introducing a small delay to ensure
# the file is properly created before attempting to read it.

# Create a file
my_file="/tmp/my_file.txt"
touch "$my_file"

# Introduce a small delay (adjust as needed)
sleep 0.1

# Read the file contents
file_contents=$(cat "$my_file")

echo "File Contents: $file_contents"

# Cleanup (ensure file is deleted even if error occurs)
rm -f "$my_file"
